# Magus Framework

This is a php based framework used almost entirely for the education of advanced code theory in PHP. This should demonstrate various patterns in use, and how they relate and interact to produce an easily maintained, modified, and extended framework for the purpose of producing websites. 

## Project Status

Currently, the Magus framework is considered to be under active development. There is no current version, as this project has only met its prototype qualifications and should be considered highly unstable. Expect major and frequent API and usage changes. Use of this codebase for any kind of production usage is not recommended. The application of this as a learning tool is also not currently recommended, as there is currently no outline as to which principles should be demonstrated, nor is it documented as any more than an afterthought.

## Roadmap

#### Database
A Database layer has been started. This will evolve to handle object-based data modelling.

#### Session Management
User authentication and session management for managing login/logout and registration of users.

#### Content Management
Basic database based content management as a plugin type architecture.

#### Properties Management
A system and mechanism for adding arbitrary properties to the 

#### Workflow Management
Manage states of all user facing objects within the site. 

## Usage
Page content can be added to the site by adding an HTML file of core content into /themes/default/templates directory.
