# Magus Framework

This is a php based framework used almost entirely for the education of advanced code theory in PHP. This should demonstrate various patterns in use, and how they relate and interact to produce an easily maintained, modified, and extended framework for the purpose of producing websites. 

## Project Status

The Magus framework is considered to be fully deprecated and is no longer under development. 

While this framework helped to demonstrate advanced PHP, framework, and CMS concepts, development has not kept up with modern development theories, such as composer, and does not utilize many of the useful features in PHP 7.

Any community contributed pull requests will be reviewed and accepted, but active development by project maintainer will no longer continue.

## Roadmap/Wishlist

#### Database
A Database layer has been started. This will evolve to handle object-based data modelling.

#### Content Management

#### Properties Management
A system and mechanism for adding arbitrary properties to the 

#### Workflow Management
Manage states of all user facing objects within the site. 

#### HTML generation framework
Generate standards based and compliant HTML code using an object based framework.

#### Form handling framework
Be able to generate forms dynamically (might end up in the HTML framework), and handle form building, validation, and submission phases.

#### YAML/XML based configuration and site building
To avoid competing workflows in code, content, and configuration workflows between deployment environments, 
configurations will be exported into YAML files

## Usage
Page content can be added to the site by adding an HTML file of core content into /themes/default/templates directory.
